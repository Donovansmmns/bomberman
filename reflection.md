# Reflection and Beta Testers

- For Bomberman, it was a challenge for me as I was using functions that I didn't full understand to try and get a better understanding of them. The hardest challenge that I had encountered would be the power-ups and environment interaction because when I would fix one problem, it would affect all my other code and make more problems. I was able to solve the environment interaction, but the power-ups for range are still not working 100%. It displays the bomb on blocks but will not affect them, but I need to fix it so the image doesn't display if it is not meant to. If I were to restart at my level of coding now, I would change things to be more efficient, such as my 3 arrays overlapping to check different detectors. The AI needs a detection to disable the bomb after placing one, otherwise I completed all need to have list requirements.

## Tester One

- Able to understand concept alone
- Break game by going on walls
- Says it needs images

## Tester Two

- Understands concept alone
- Does not break game
- Says it needs images
- Suggest a cooldown on bombs placed
