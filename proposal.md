# Major Project Proposal

## Description
My goal is to make the game Bomberman. I plan to have proper interactions with hitboxes, collision, and character upgrades that can be found when breaking obstacles - very similar to the real game.
## Need To Have List
- Start menu
- Choice of player amount
- Upgrades within game
- Level select
- Unit collision
- Hitbox interaction
## Nice To Have List
- Functioning AI
- Images to visually appeal player(s)
- Animations for explosions, movement, character death
- Score / Highscore
