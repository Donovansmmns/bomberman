My goal is to make the game Bomberman. I plan to have proper interactions with hitboxes, collision, and character upgrades that can be found when breaking obstacles - as close as possible to the real game.
## Need To Have List
- Start menu
- Choice of player amount
- Player controls

- Level select
- Unit collision
- Hitbox interaction
## Nice To Have List
- Functioning AI
- Difficulty setting on AI
