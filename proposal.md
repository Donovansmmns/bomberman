# Major Project Proposal

## Description
My goal is to make the game Bomberman. I plan to have proper interactions with hitboxes, collision, and character upgrades that can be found when breaking obstacles - as close as possible to the real game.
## Need To Have List
- Start menu
- Level select
- Choice of player amount
- Player controls
- Simple AI
- Upgrades within game
- Unit collision
- Hitbox interaction
- Environment affected by bombs
- Life count
- Win/Lose situation
## Nice To Have List
- Advanced AI
- Difficulty setting on AI
- Ability for AI to collect upgrades
- Images to visually appeal player(s)
- Animations for explosions, movement, character death
- Score based on amount of time it takes to win
- Remember the highscore for each level
- Different blocks with unique interactions
- Smooth walking, not block by block
